The intent of this Project is to over time develop a pdf receipt generator for items purchased in a vurtial store.

Overall: There will be a database of hardware for sale including name, quanitity, and prices. The system will
display all the available content in the store. The user can continuously shop for hardware until ready to checkout.
Once checked out, the database will update stock and a pdf document will be locally saved containing a receipt of
all purchased hardware.

Step 1: Create a database with hardware stock
Step 2: Link database to main.py file
Step 3: List database contents to user
Step 4: Allow user to add hardware to Cart
Step 5: System must check actions are correct
Step 6: When user is done, database should save remaining contents
Step 7: Receipt should generate with purchase contents and total spent
